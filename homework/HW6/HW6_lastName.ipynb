I suggest checking out this [plot gallery](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/index.html) from the `matplotlib` creators. If you click a plot, you will see code that shows how the plot was made. There is a nice scatter plot on the top row that was made with the `plot` command. There are a ton of these plot galleries online and it is a great way to figure out how to make a new plot!"
